Make a Bicycle Light

## Legality
[Germany | Allowed **only** with Certification](https://www.tuvsud.com/de-de/wissenswert/insicht/fahrradbeleuchtung)

## Factors to consider
- Cost
- Duration
- Power Consumption
- Weight
- Safety
- Brightness
- Water-proofing

- Battery replacable
- CRI (Colour Rendering Index)
- USB Recharge Port

## parts
### necessary

- [ ] LED (Light Emitting Diode)
- [ ] Battery
- [ ] Reflector
- [ ] Lens
- [ ] on/off switch
- [ ] usb type-c power receiver Board

### optional

- [ ] PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
- [ ] focus mechanism
- [ ] Heat sink + thermal compound
- [ ] cable sleeving

## LED

### current sensitive device 
- can draw more current then designed
- to much current reduces life span

low powered led can just be used with a resistore

### COP (Chip On Board)

- Brighter
- harder to focus
- requires advanced curcuitry
    - Led Drivers
    - Voltage regulator

### LED Strips
